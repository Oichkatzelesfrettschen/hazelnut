L4/KA README

1. Getting Started

 To build the kernel and sample applications simply run the provided
 `build.sh` helper script from the top of the tree:

```
src/l4-ka > ./build.sh
```

If no configuration exists the script copies the default one from
`kernel/xconfig/defconfig` before starting the build.  The resulting
kernel image will be `x86-kernel` (or matching your selected architecture)
and the application binaries will reside in their respective subdirectories.
